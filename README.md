#Grocery List Manager## Explanation of the projectThis project was created in order to simplify grocery shopping by making an app that has many different features in order to attain this goal. The app allows for as many grocery list a user wants, allows users to check items off in their grocery list, add as many items as they want, makes adding items easy through different lookup methods which are by type or by name, allows users to create items if they don't exist and allows users to edit each item on the list through adding/removing quantity and the ability to delete the item. All the features the app contains are all to make it easy for all users to create a grocery list and edit them.## OutcomeThe outcome of the app was great in my opinion, the design is simple yet clean and contains many buttons which are useful and easy to use for users. This app taught me a lot of skills about Android Studios and how to use it in order to make adapters in order to create something which Android Studios does not directly provide. I also learned to use databases to persist data and many other skills.## User Manual ### Window 1 [![Grocery-List-Page-1.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/GtrWrBxZ/Grocery-List-Page-1.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/qhbbxvYL)- When the App launches you will be shown the home page where your current Grocery Lists.- If you have lists already pressing one of them will take you to the list manager for that list.- If there are no list available there is a button with the "+" symbol that you can press to create a new grocery list.- A prompt will show up asking you to name the list and when you name the list you will be taken to the second window.### Window 2[![Grocery-List-Page-2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/DfPV6g2F/Grocery-List-Page-2.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/dD3StGkS)- The second window is where the list is edited, we call it the list manager.
